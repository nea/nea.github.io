🚢 Ahoy there, Savas speaking (or writing to be precise)!

I am doing tech... mostly! And some management, leadership, business and a lot of other stuff. A jack-of-all-trades or master of chaos if you will.
☕ By day, I am juggling projects and make software, listen to clients and drink coffee. 
⌨️ By night, a keyboard cowboy, committing code and ranting about interesting tech news I read about.

This collects my opinionated thoughts about agile, cloud, ai and all the fancy buzzword bingo.
No matter if Scrum or Rust, Agile or Cloud, LLMs or IoT... I have seen a lot and I do have an opinion about everything ^^
As there is not "the solution", things are non-deterministic. Therefore, I just provide another view.

Enjoy, if you will 😅
