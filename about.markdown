Ahoy there, Savas speaking (or writing to be precise)!

I am doing tech... mostly! And some management, leadership, business and a lot of other stuff. A jack-of-all-trades or master of chaos if you will.
By day, I am juggling projects and make software, listen to clients and drink coffee. 
By night, a keyboard cowboy, committing code and writing about interesting tech news I read about.

This collects my opinionated thoughts about agile, cloud, ai and all the fancy buzzword bingo and you are free to stay or look for other entertainment sources.
No matter if Scrum or Rust, Agile or Cloud, LLMs or IoT... I have seen a lot and an opinion about everything ^^
As a solution is mostly non-deterministic, I just provide another view here.

Enjoy, if you will :)
